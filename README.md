## Interactive-3D-Percolation-Pathway-Visualization ##
This interesting project is a 3D percolation model to provide the conductive pathway in non-conductive media.

### Percolation Probability Value Estimation ###
This project conjudates with the Interactive-3D-Percolation-Pathway-Visualization project, which predict the percolation probability based on the coductive media fraction(Volume fraction in %) as inputs.

### Prompts to optimize this project ###
Structured Outline of Prompts for 3D Scientific Visualization Development

-1-. #### Initial Setup and Basic Visualization ####
"Create a 3D visualization of [specific system] using Julia with Plots and PlutoUI. Start with a basic grid and simple representation of particles."

-2-. #### Implementing Core Algorithm ####
"Implement the [specific algorithm] algorithm. The algorithm should [describe desired behavior and output]."

-3-. #### Refining Visualization ####
"Modify the visualization to distinguish between different types of particles. For example, [describe particle types and their significance]."

-4-. #### Adjusting Particle Representation ####
"Adjust the size and color of the particles to better represent their roles in the system. Make [type A] particles [size/color], and [type B] particles [size/color]."

-5-. #### Enhancing 3D Perspective ####
"Add a complete 3D box frame around the visualization to provide better spatial context. Ensure all edges of the cube are visible."

-6-. #### Fine-tuning Visibility #### 
"Adjust the transparency of [specific elements] to improve overall visibility and emphasize [important features]."

-7-. #### Completing System Representation #### 
"Are we missing any elements in our visualization? If so, add [missing elements] to provide a complete representation of the system."

-8-. #### Optimization for Publication ####
"Optimize this visualization for publication. Adjust the camera angle, resolution, and overall format to meet publication standards. Also, add an appropriate title to the plot."

-9-. #### Adding Interactivity #### 
"Make this visualization interactive. Add a slider for [relevant parameter] and a button to update the visualization."

-10-. #### Final Refinements ####
"Review the visualization and suggest any final refinements that would enhance its clarity, accuracy, or aesthetic appeal for scientific presentation."
