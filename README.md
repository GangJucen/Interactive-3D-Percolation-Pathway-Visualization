### Interactive-3D-Percolation-Pathway-Visualization ###
This interesting project is a 3D percolation model to provide the conductive pathway in non-conductive media.

### Percolation Probability Value Estimation ###
This project conjudates with the Interactive-3D-Percolation-Pathway-Visualization project, which predict the percolation probability based on the coductive media fraction(Volume fraction in %) as inputs.

### Prompts to Generate this project ###
Structured Outline of Prompts for 3D Scientific Visualization Development

Initial Setup and Basic Visualization
"Create a 3D visualization of [specific system] using Julia with Plots and PlutoUI. Start with a basic grid and simple representation of particles."
Implementing Core Algorithm
"Implement the [specific algorithm] algorithm. The algorithm should [describe desired behavior and output]."
Refining Visualization
"Modify the visualization to distinguish between different types of particles. For example, [describe particle types and their significance]."
Adjusting Particle Representation
"Adjust the size and color of the particles to better represent their roles in the system. Make [type A] particles [size/color], and [type B] particles [size/color]."
Enhancing 3D Perspective
"Add a complete 3D box frame around the visualization to provide better spatial context. Ensure all edges of the cube are visible."
Fine-tuning Visibility
"Adjust the transparency of [specific elements] to improve overall visibility and emphasize [important features]."
Completing System Representation
"Are we missing any elements in our visualization? If so, add [missing elements] to provide a complete representation of the system."
Optimization for Publication
"Optimize this visualization for publication. Adjust the camera angle, resolution, and overall format to meet publication standards. Also, add an appropriate title to the plot."
Adding Interactivity
"Make this visualization interactive. Add a slider for [relevant parameter] and a button to update the visualization."
Final Refinements
"Review the visualization and suggest any final refinements that would enhance its clarity, accuracy, or aesthetic appeal for scientific presentation."
